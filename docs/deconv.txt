Cell-type deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data

Cell-type deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data was performed using CIBERSORTx with the LM22 leukocyte gene signature matrix, which contains 547 genes derived from human microarray data to distinguish 22 immune cell types. Cell types were imputed using both standard and grouped modes with B-mode batch correction, quantile normalization disabled, 1000 permutations, and relative mode to estimate the proportions of each immune cell type per sample. For selected comparisons, absolute mode was also used. Only protein-coding transcripts were included when running the high-resolution mode, and additional details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Relative cell-type proportions obtained from CIBERSORTx were compared between predefined study groups using non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction) with a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05. No immune cell type displayed statistically significant differences in relative abundance between affected and unaffected groups after multiple-testing correction (all FDR-adjusted p > 0.05). Nominal trends were observed for monocytes, activated dendritic cells, and naïve CD4⁺ T cells prior to adjustment. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.5.1 using the rstatix, MASS, and FSA packages.
