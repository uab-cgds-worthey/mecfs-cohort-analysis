This site presents a differential gene expression analysis conducted by CGDS on 23 individuals diagnosed with ME/CFS using bulk RNA-seq.

Data was processed with the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq) pipeline and quantified using Salmon to identify transcriptional changes related to immune and metabolic dysregulation.

The site was built with [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
