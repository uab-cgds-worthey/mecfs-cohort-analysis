# Project Background

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a severely disabling, chronic illness that affects approximately 1-3 million Americans. ME/CFS can be briefly described as presenting with severe unrelenting fatigue,widespread unexplained pain, general malaise or feelings of illness described as flu-like,post-exertional malaise syndrome which is characterized by the drastic reduction in physical and mental ability following exertion of any kind, GI and digestive problems,mental fogginess, and cardio-pulmonary abnormalities. The cause of ME/CFS is not well understood. The majority of ME/CFS patients can recall a time of either sudden onset of dysfunction from an illness or a gradual decline in function, and this most often occurs in adulthood. Many biological abnormalities have been identified in ME/CFS patients, such as altered cytokine responses indicating increased systemic inflammation, altered metabolic profiling, dysregulation of the immune system, and neuroinflammation. Despite a delay in initiation of genetic studies, there is now a growing body of knowledge indicating an underlying genetic predisposition. Studies have shown that having a family member with ME/CFS is one of the strongest predictive factors for the presence of disease; first-degree relatives of affected individuals were found to be three times more likely to develop ME/CFS than controls. We hypothesized that ME/CFS is a genetically inherited disease that results in disrupted metabolic regulation of the immune system,thus resulting in an inappropriately activated immune system.

# Methods 


## Performing WGS Analysis

## Performing Bulk RNASeq Analysis

We have collected RNA samples on 29 ME/CFS patients for expression analysis and performed bulk RNA sequencing via Vantage. 

Our lab uses nf-core's rnaseq pipeline for secondary analysis which we've modified to work on the cluster, Cheaha, that we use.
