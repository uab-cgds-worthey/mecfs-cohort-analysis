Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic, disabling illness affecting an estimated 1–3 million Americans. It is marked by persistent fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, pain, and a range of immune, metabolic, and neurological symptoms.

Onset often follows infection or occurs gradually in adulthood. Research has identified biological abnormalities in ME/CFS, including immune dysregulation, altered cytokine profiles, metabolic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation.

Family studies suggest a genetic component, with first-degree relatives of ME/CFS patients at increased risk.


## Methods

### Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis

Peripheral blood RNA was collected from 29 ME/CFS patients for transcriptomic profiling. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed by Vantage.

We used the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq) pipeline for secondary analysis. This pipeline was modified to run on UAB’s Cheaha high-performance computing cluster.
